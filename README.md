# Music Data Analysis & Recommendation System
Welcome to the GitHub repository of our Music Data Analysis & Recommendation System project! This project is all about diving deep into a dataset that encompasses various music tracks, artists, albums, genres, and more, to unearth insights and patterns. The culmination of this analysis is the development of a sophisticated recommendation system designed to personalize user experiences by suggesting tracks and artists.

Project Overview
Our journey through the data begins with a meticulous cleaning process, followed by an exploratory data analysis that looks into artist counts, album counts, genres, and more. Through quantitative analysis, we delve into the relationships between different musical attributes and genres. The project aims to not only provide insights into the dataset but also to leverage this information to create a recommendation system based on user preferences.
